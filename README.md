# Collect Hearts
"Collect Hearts" is an intriguing AR project that marks my introduction to the world of creating augmented reality (AR) games. With a strong desire to explore the possibilities of AR game development, I embarked on this project with the primary goal of learning and experimenting with various AR features and techniques.

In "Collect Hearts," I delved into the fundamentals of AR game mechanics, leveraging the capabilities of ARKit and ARCore frameworks to create an immersive and interactive experience. The objective of the game is to collect as many hearts as possible, strategically placed within the player's physical surroundings. By incorporating intuitive touch gestures and dynamic interactions, I aimed to provide a glimpse into the potential of AR gaming.

While "Collect Hearts" has not been commercially released, it represents an important stepping stone in my AR development journey. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of AR game design, including marker detection, object tracking, and spatial mapping. I experimented with different approaches and techniques, allowing me to develop a solid foundation in AR game development.

Although I am still in the process of mastering AR game development, "Collect Hearts" showcases the progress I have made in understanding and utilizing AR features. The project serves as a testament to my passion for exploring emerging technologies and my commitment to continuous learning and growth as a game developer.
